# Covid-19 Projects

How we respond to challenging times is what makes us the most human. Several of us are taking this time to give back to the community by putting in efforts to build solutions to help others in these times. In the past few months, the community has contributed to myriads of initiatives related to COVID-19. 

We want to show our love by amplifying the work of some of the creators who are contributing to this collective effort. Here are a few of many such projects that exemplify how the community is responding to COVID-19 by building web & software solutions. 

## 1. [Fieldfusion](https://corona.fieldfusion.io/) 🔗

Fieldfusion is a free & online tool built to help Field Service professionals make faster, data-driven decisions and ensure the safety of their technicians by analysing the effect of COVID-19 in the region of operation. Although, Fieldfusion's primary aim is to help Field Service professionals, it is also freely available for public usage.

Fieldfusion enables users to upload/enter and search for a specific postal code to help visualise the number of active COVID-19 cases in the region and analyse how severely coronavirus is affecting various geographic regions in the UK. The tool utilises publicly available data from Public Health England (PHE), the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and Ordnance Survey (OS). Fieldfusion lists the most severely affected regions by comparing the number of confirmed cases to the total population in specific areas.

**Note**: Fieldfusion is currently only for use in UK and the accuracy of the data is limited to England.

## 2. [Survive Together](https://survivetogether.org/) 🔗

Due to the prevailing curfew in many countries, people living in certain areas are finding it difficult to get groceries, vegetables, fruits, and other essential items. Through this website, vendors can inform people about their services and people can state their needs as well.

At the moment, for some of us, the only way to obtain food and groceries is through deliveries. No one can go out of their house for weeks. While there are many delivery options in some areas, we noticed that most of the areas won't get anything. Those people are helpless. One of the main targets of this website is to gather enough information to identify those key areas and make sure everyone gets what they need.
