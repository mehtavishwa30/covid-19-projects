# Covid-19 Projects

How we respond to challenging times is what makes us the most human. Several of us are taking this time to give back to the community by putting in efforts to build solutions to help others in these times. In the past few months, the community has contributed to myriads of initiatives related to COVID-19. 

We want to show our love by amplifying the work of some of the creators who are contributing to this collective effort. Here are a few of many such projects that exemplify how the community is responding to COVID-19 by building web & software solutions. 

## Fieldfusion

Fieldfusion is free online tool built to aid decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst aimed primarily at Field Service professionals, it is also freely available for use by the general public.

The tool utilises publicly available data from Public Health England (PHE), the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and Ordnance Survey (OS) to show how severely coronavirus is affecting different geographic regions in the UK. By comparing the number of confirmed cases to the total population in specific areas we are able to show which regions have been affected most severely.

Users are able to enter a list or upload a CSV file of UK Post Codes for places where essential work or travel must be undertaken. This helps Field Service organisations make swift, data-driven decisions, improve technician safety, and respond at scale.

Please note: data is accurate for England at the present time due to the differences between available geographic data and the regions for which the devolved governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland report the number of cases.

The tool is freely available to use on the web. Due to GDPR considerations we made the decision to anonymise usage data but have received good feedback on social media on it's use by Field Service organisations, as well as other companies looking to collaborate and expand on the project.

## Survive Together

Due to the prevailing curfew in many countries, people living in certain areas are finding it difficult to get groceries, vegetables, fruits, and other essential items. Through this website, vendors can inform people about their services and people can state their needs as well.

At the moment, for some of us, the only way to obtain food and groceries is through deliveries. No one can go out of their house for weeks. While there are many delivery options in some areas, we noticed that most of the areas won't get anything. Those people are helpless. One of the main targets of this website is to gather enough information to identify those key areas and make sure everyone gets what they need.
